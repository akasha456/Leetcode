    Complexity Summary:
    Time Complexity: O(n) (single pass, constant-time lookups)
    Space Complexity: O(n) (hashmap storing at most n elements)

''' This solution efficiently finds two numbers that sum to target using a hash map.
    It iterates through nums, checking if the complement (target - num) is already storedâ€”if yes, it returns the indices;
    otherwise, it adds the current number to the hash map for future lookups.'''
'''
    If (target - num) is already in the hashmap, it means we've previously seen a number that, when added to num, equals target.
